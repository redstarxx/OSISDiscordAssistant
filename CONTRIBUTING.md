# Contributing Guidelines
While we appreciate your effort in improving this project, we ask that you follow the guidelines as you do so.

## Pull Requests
- Ensure that your PR is targeting the main branch and it is even with the target branch.
- Commit messages must describe the changes made. If you fixed or resolved an open issue, please reference it by using the # notation. Example: `Fixed reminders not sending reminder message when it should.`
- Your code changes must build successfully. This will be verified by our CI upon the creation of your pull request. GitHub's .NET Core CI handles this task. If the build fails, your PR will not be accepted. This does not apply if your PR does not affect how the code works in any way (XML documentation, etcetera).

## Issues
Please specify:
- Changes requested;
- Problems found;
- If applicable, a proposal on how to implement it.
